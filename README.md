# XellGrid

XellGrid is a project branched out of the discontinued Qgrid project. The first release of XellGrid is to add support to JupyterLab with enhanced UI.  

Our goal is to create a powerful Jupyter enabled grid with rich "Excel" like UI features to enable regular users/analysts to benefit from 
the computational power of Python and cloud analytics through "low code/no code" principles.
